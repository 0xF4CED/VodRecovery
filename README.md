# VodRecovery
* The purpose of this script is to obtain videos or clips that are either marked as "sub-only" or have been deleted on Twitch. 

# About
* Developed by: Shishkebaboo (formerly ItIckeYd, the original developer who is back to work on the project after a hiatus)
* Initial release: May 3rd, 2022
* The script leverages logic from the [TwitchRecover](https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover) repository developed by [Daylam Tayari](https://github.com/daylamtayari)

# Features
* Supports both manual and website vod recovery
* Can recover vods individually or in bulk using a CSV downloaded from [Sullygnome](https://sullygnome.com/)
* Can recover clips manually or in bulk using a CSV from [Sullygnome](https://sullygnome.com/)
* Supports downloading M3U8 links/files, with the ability to specify start/end timestamps for trimmed vods using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
* Compatible with [TwitchTracker](https://twitchtracker.com/), [Sullygnome](https://sullygnome.com/), and [Streamscharts](https://streamscharts.com/)
* Uses UTC timezone as default for recovering vods
* Notifies if vod is older than 60 days (due to Twitch's deletion process)

# Optional IDEs
* [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) (recommended)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

# Additional Notes
* Provide at least one example when creating an issue
* If the script returns no results, try vods from other streamers. If the other vods return results, it is likely that the original vods don't exist
* Any vod requests that exceed [Twitch's vod retention policy](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand) will be ignored
